2012 Jan 27 (1:00 PM)
---------------------

Released to CS409



2012 Jan 27 (4:30 PM)
---------------------

1. draw() no longer crashes when a material refernces an image that cannot be loaded.
2. Added support for Tf command in MTL files
3. Added warning for entirely-transparent material

Released to CS809



2012 Jan 30
-----------

1. Images now load correctly when a bad image is specified first



2012 Feb 1
----------

1. Added SpriteFont.h/.cpp



2012 Feb 3
----------

2012 Feb 14
-----------

1. Decreased the percision of the isNormal()/isUnit() function in Vector3.  A Vector3 normalized with the normalize() (or getNormalized() ) function should now count as normalized.
2. Fixed getDisplayList() in the ObjModel class to not include loading the texture in the display list it returns.  This makes drawing the model 5ish times faster.

2012 September 4
----------------

1. Changed all preprocessor directives from __FILENAME_H__ to FILENAME_H to comply with C++ language specifications: "__" is reserved for compiler-defined macros.



2012 September 19
-----------------

1. Changed source files for BoundedArray, PriorityQueue, and Vector from .cpp to .inl.



2012 September 26
-----------------

6. Added a few more assert tests.



2013 January 8
--------------

1. Added component-wise multiplication and division to Vector3 class.
2. Fixed a few minor documentation errors in Vector3.h and added a few more assert tests.
3. Added init function to TextureBmp to create a blank image of a specified size.
4. Added Vector2 class.
5. TextureManager class now flips Bmp textures files after loading to match Maya's interpretation.  Previously matched Wavefront documentation (I think).



2013 January 20
---------------

1. Added #include <cstdlib> to ObjModel.cpp - required for atoi function.
2. Changed return type of isDistanceLessThan function in Vector2 and Vector3 to bool (was double).
3. Changed random functions in Random.cpp to random0, random1, random2 to avoid POSIX name conflicts.
4. Replaced call to _isfinite function in Vector3.cpp with platform-resolving macro.  Currently non-windows just returns true instead of checking.
5. Added #include <string> to CircularArray.inl for NULL constant.



2013 January 25
---------------

1. Changed implementation of random0 to avoid integer wraparound on g++.
2. ObjModel class now used Vector2 class to represent texture coordinates instead of custom type.
3. Added optional (macro-controlled) support for loading .png images (using third-party libraries).
4. Loading errors from an MTL file now go in the error file/stream specified for the OBJ file the requires it instead of to stderr.
5. Replaced call to _isfinite function in Vector2.cpp as in Vector3.cpp.
6. Added error message for loading invalid texture type.



2013 March 18
-------------

1. Added isNormLessThan() function to Vector2 and Vector3.
2. Modified texture flip to apply to all textures, not just BMP files.



2013 March 25
-------------

1. Added isNormGreaterThan() function to Vector2 and Vector3.



2013 March 26
-------------

-------------

1. Added newline at end of Random.cpp to fix POSIX compile errors.



2013 May 14
-----------

1. Fixed add() functions in TextureManager to convert internal names with lowercase.  Previously, names with uppercase characters prevented texture being selected from list, defaulting to reloading the file.



2013 June 14
------------

1. Replaced all Vector<>s with std::vector<>s.
2. Vector<> is no longer required to display OBJ models.
3. Warnings in MtlLibrary for entirely transparent materials now print to logfile instead of standard output.
4. Component-wise multiplication must now be explictly specified for Vector2 and Vector3 instead of being the overloaded meaning of the multiplication operator.
5. Added setSize() function to BoundedGrid.



2013 June 15
------------

1. Added in-place rotation functions to Vector2 and Vector3.
2. Renamed texture_manager namespace to TextureMnager to comply to conventions.
3. Added isEmpty() function to ObjModel.



2013 June 21
------------

1. Renamed Bounded3DGrid<> to Bounded3dGrid<>.
2. Changed default sizes of BoundedGrid<> and Bounded3dGrid<> to static member constants from global constants in anonymous namespaces.  The namespaces were being included in any file the classes were used, which lead to conflicts.
3. Added non-const get function to BoundedGrid<> and Bounded3dGrid<>.



2013 July 22
------------

1. Added versions isNormLessThan and isNormGreaterThan functions that compare to another vector insteead of a scaler.



2014 January 7
--------------

1. Added Ni for optical density (index of refraction) to MTL loader.



2014 January 20
---------------

1. Added templated UpdatablePriorityQueue.



2014 January 24
---------------

1. Updated documentation in Vector2/3.h to say class instead of record.
2. Fixed bug where setUp2dView function in SpriteFont crashed if given a non-postitive window size.  This happens if you minimize the window.



2014 March 13
-------------

1. Added getNormlaizedSafe, getCopyWithNormSafe, normalizeSafe, setNormSafe functions to Vector2/3.h that quietly pass through zero vectors.
2. Renamed is2DViewSetUp, setUp2DView, and unsetUp2DView functions to is2dViewSetUp, setUp2dView, and unsetUp2dView to comply with naming conventions.
3. Added support for non-strandard "Km" command in MTL files (interpreted to specify bump multiplier).
4. Fixed bug to write bump multiplier to MTL files only when non-default instead of vice versa.
5. "o" lines in OBJ models no longer generate an error message (but are still ignored).



2014 March 21
-------------

1. Renamed cosAngle to getCosAngle in Vector2/3 classes to conply with naming convention.
2. Added getTruncated, truncate, getAngle, getCosAngleSafe, and getAngleSafe functions to Vector2/3 classes.
3. Changed data type for default MtlLibrary name from const std::string to const char*.  This should fix the dependancy on file compilation order.  I hope.
4. You can now specify an error stream or file to the TextureBmp class and TextureManager service.



2014 April 3
------------

1. Added copyright notice to all files.
2. Subsumed ObjStringOperations.h/.cpp into ObjStringParsing.h/.cpp.



2014 October 17
---------------

1. Standardized "public:", "protected:", and "private:" to never have leading spaces in class declarations.
2. Improved whitespace in Vector2.h/.cpp and Vector3.h/.cpp.  They should now display correctly with any tab size.
3. Added isAllComponentsNonZero, isAllComponentsNonNegative, and isAllComponentsPositive functions to Vector2 and Vector3.
4. Added isAllComponentsLessThan, isAllComponentsLessThanOrEqual, isAllComponentsGreaterThan, and isAllComponentsGreaterThanOrEqual functions to Vector2 and Vector3 that compare to a double or another Vector2/Vector3.  Also added an isAllComponentsEqualTo function that compares to a double.  The vector-comparison version would be the equality test.
5. Added componentRatio and componentRatioSafe functions to Vector2 and Vector3 that divide trhe corresponding elements in vectors.



2014 November 17
----------------

1. Clarified terms of use to allow authority figures (professors, employers, etc.) to limit the use of ObjLibrary in their area of authority (assignments, company projects, etc.).
2. Added getComponentX, getComponentY, and getComponentZ to Vector2 and Vector3 that make copies with all but one element set to 0.0.
3. Added getComponentXY, getComponentXZ, and getComponentYZ to Vector3 that make copies with all but two elements set to 0.0.
4. Improved documentation for Vector2 and Vedctor3 classes to appear for all copies of similar functions (e.g. isUnit and isNormal).  Achieved by copying documentation for each function.



2015 January 6
--------------

1. Removed error messages when loading an ObjModel with otehrwise blank "g", "o", or "s" lines.
2. Changed "ERROR: " to "Error: " for OBJ model file does not exist error message.



2015 January 8
--------------

1. Added a conveniance version of getMatrixProduct to Vector3 that takes 3 Vector3s as parameters instead of a 9 doubles.
2. Added isOrthogonal to Vector2 and Vector3.
3. Added IsParallel to Vector2.  Previously was only in Vector3.
4. getRotatedAxes in Vector3 is now getRotatedXZAxes.



2015 January 13
---------------

1. Fixed componentProduct, componentRatio, and componentRatioSafe in Vetcor2 and Vector3 to be const functions.
2. Removed superflouous preconditions for unsigned char versions of drawVertices and drawWireframe in ObjModel.



2015 January 15 (10:30 AM)
--------------------------

1. Reversed assignment of Y-coordinates for .bmp files.  Now matches Maya and .png.  This is probably the opposite of the Wavefront standard, but I am not sure about that...



2015 January 15 (4:00 PM)
-------------------------

1. Added getCosAngleNormal and getAngleNormal to Vector2 and Vector3 that require to normal vectors.  These are faster than the plain getCosAngle and getAngle.



2015 January 26
---------------

1. Replaced version of Vector3 getMatrixProduct taking 3 Vector3s as parameters with two versions named getMatrixProductRows and getMatrixProductColumns that treat them as row and column vectors respectively.  The column version is correct for change-of-basis calculations.



2015 January 30
---------------

1. Improved whitespace in ObjModel.h.  It should now display correctly with any tab size.
2. ObjModel now stores file name and file path as seperate values.  getName has been replaced with getFileName, getFilePath, and getFileNameWithPath.  Similarly for setName.
3. Improved filename validity checking for ObjModel: paths without a filename at the end are now detected.
4. Added isLoadedSuccessfully function to ObjModel to determine if the ObjModel was successfully loaded from a file.



2015 February 6
---------------

1. Improved whitespace in MtlLibrary.h.  It should now display correctly with any tab size.
2. MtlLibrary now stores file name and file path as seperate values.  getName has been replaced with getFileName, getFilePath, and getFileNameWithPath.  Similarly for setName.
3. Improved filename validity checking for ObjModel: paths without a filename at the end are now detected.
4. Added isLoadedSuccessfully function to MtlLibrary to determine if the MtlLibrary was successfully loaded from a file.
5. Added makeEmpty function to MtlLibrary to transform an existing MtlLibrary into the state created by the default constructor.
6. Improved a few comments in ObjLibrary.h
7. Texture usage priority order is now diffuse, ambient, specular.
8. Added an option for file path propagation (enabled by default).  If your OBJ and MTL files already include the relative path from your working directory, call ObjModel::setPathPropagation(false); before loading anything to restore the old behaviour.
9. Default file names are now in lowercase and include file extension.



2015 February 12
----------------

1. Updated ObjModel to refer to "lines" as "polylines" and "face sets" as "meshes".
2. Added isAllTriangles and getDisplayListMaterialNone functions to ObjModel.



2015 March 3
------------

1. Added setAll function to Vector2 and Vector3 to set all components to a value.  I didn't add a constructor variant because I think it would cause too many bugs.
2. Added getMinComponents and getMaxComponents to Vector2 and Vector3 that are basically min and max for each component.
3. Added getRandomInRange functions to Vector2 and Vector3.
4. Added getRandomUnitVectorXY, getRandomUnitVectorXZ, and getRandomUnitVectorYZ functions to Vector3.



2015 March 5
------------

1. Added isNormXYLessThan, etc. functions to Vector3.
2. String equality is now compared with equality and inequality test operators (== and !=) instead of string::compare function.



2015 August 11
--------------

1. Textures can now load from the same directory as the material file when loaded implicitly from a call to activate().  It is now possible to set the texture ppath for a material.



2015 August 12
--------------

1. Illumination mode 0 (constant illumination and lighting disabled) now uses ambient + diffuse instead of ambient + diffuse / 2.  Models should no longer appear at half brightness.
2. Improved spacing in MtlLibrary.h and ObjLibrary.h.
3. Added get/set for texture coordinates as a Vector2 in ObjModel.
4. Added drawMaterial function to ObjModel that takes a string as a parameter and searches current material files.  Also a variaent where you specifiy a material file.
5. Added functions to activate and deactive materials directly from MtlLibrary.
6. Added isMaterial() and getMaterial() functions to MtlLibraryManager.



2015 August 15
--------------

1. Added isNormLessThanOrEqual and isNormGreaterThanOrEqual to Vector2 and Vector3.
2. Added isAllComponentsNegative and isAllComponentsNonPositive to Vector2 and Vector3.
3. Added getRandomSphereVector and getRandomInRangeInclusive to Vector2 and Vector3.
4. Added getAntiProjection to Vector2 and Vector3.
5. Added randomBool to Random.h.



2015 August 16
--------------

1. Improved spacing in DisplayList.h.
2. Added isEmpty, isPartial, and isReady query functions to DisplayList class.  Preconditions for existing functions now use these when appropriate.
3. Texture manager now loads PNG images with alpha channel from image.



2015 August 22
--------------

1. Added getPsuedorandomUnitVector function to Vector2 and Vector3 classs and getPsuedorandomUnitVectorXY, getPsuedorandomUnitVectorXZ, getPsuedorandomUnitVectorYZ to Vector3 class.  These act the like random version but take seed values.



2015 September 14
-----------------

1. Added functions to ObjModel to remove point sets, polylines, meshes, and faces.  Also added functions remove the vertexes composing them, singley or all at once.
2. Changed addPointSetVertex, addPolylineVertex, and addFaceVertex in ObjModel to start numbering at 0.  This brings it into conformity with the rest of the, but no longer matches the OBJ file.  A note was added to the class description explaining this.
3. Changed print function in ObjModel class for clarity.  Now prints "N faces" instead of just "N".



2015 September 23
-----------------

1. Fixed isMeshMaterial is ObjLibrary to return true if there is a material and false otherwise.  Was the other way around.
2. Added versions of print, printMtlLibraries, and printBadMaterials to ObjLibrary that take a logfile and a logging stream as parameters.
3. Clarified documentation for setPolylineVertexTextureCoordinates, setFaceVertexTextureCoordinates, and setFaceVertexNormal to explicitly state the effect of NO_TEXTURE_COORDINATES and NO_NORMAL as arguments.



2015 October 2
--------------

1. Fixed documentation for isNormGreaterThan, getAntiProjection, and getRandomSphereVector functions in Vector2 to say Vettor2 instead of Vector3.
2. Fixed documentation for isNormLessThanOrEqual and isNormGreaterThanOrEqual functions in Vector3 to say Vector3 instead of Vector2.
3. Added versions of getRandomInRange and getRandomInRangeIncluusive functions to Vector2 and Vector3 classes that take 0 and 1 parameters.
4. Added getPsuedorandomSphereVector and 3 getPsuedorandomInRange functions to Vector2 and Vector3 classes.  These act the like random version but take seed values.



2015 October 17
---------------

1. Added getClampedComponent functions to Vector2 and Vector3 classes that take dioubles and Vector2/3s as parameters.  These impose a minimum and maximum on each component.
2. Added file ObjSettings.h to store ObjLibray options.  Options were previously in whichever header file seemed most conveniant.
3. Moved path propogation global state from ObjModel.h to ObjSettings.h and converted it to a macro named OBJ_LIBRARY_PATH_PROPAGATION.
4. Moved OBJ_LIBRARY_SHADER_DISPLAY macro from ObjModel.h to ObjSettings.h.
5. Moved OBJ_LIBRARY_LOAD_PNG_TEXTURES macro from TextureManager.h to ObjSettings.h.
6. Fixed addMaterialLibrary(library, logfile) to call addMaterialLibrary(library, logstream) ionstead of load(library, logstream).
7. Renamed projection function in Vector2 and Vector3 to getProgection.  I hope this doesn't break too much.



2015 October 18
---------------

1. Added add and addAll functions to Vector2/3.  These increase the components instead of setting them.



2015 October 20
---------------

1. Improved getRotatedArbitrary and rotateArbitrary functions in Vector3 class.  Internal Matrix3x3 class now uses 3x3 instead of corner of 9x9 and has size constants as members.  Identity matrix is now declared in each function instead of at file scaope, ensuring it is always initialized.



2015 October 22
---------------

1. Renamed add and addAll functions in Vector2/3 to addComponents and addComponentsAll.



2015 October 25
---------------

1. Renamed componentProduct, componentRatio, and componentRatioSafe functions in Vector2/3 to getComponentProduct, getComponentRatio, and getComponentRatioSafe.
2. Added getNormRatio and getNormRatioSafe functions to Vector2/3.
3. Added isDistanceEqual function to Vector2/3.
4. Improved spacing and documentation in TextureManager.h, TextureManager.cpp, MtlLibrary.h, and MtlLibraryManager.h.
5. Added versions of the get and activate function in TextureManager that take a wrapping mode and magnification and minification filters as parameters.



2015 October 26
---------------

1. Added isNormEqualTo functions to Vector2 and Vector3 that take a double or a Vector2/3 as a parameter.



2015 November 12
----------------

1. Changed return type for isNormLessThan, isNormLessThanOrEqual, isNormGreaterThan, isNormGreaterThanOrEqual, and isNormEqualTo functions to Vector2 and Vector3 to return a bool instead of a double.



2015 November 13
----------------

1. Added a constant for floating point error in normal calculations to Vector2 and Vector3 classes.  Updated all class functions and descriptions to use it.
2. Added tolerances to less than and greater than comparisons for norms and distances in Vector2 and Vector3 classes.  Removed less/greater than or equal comparisons as redundant.
3. Minor formatting and documentation fixes to Vector2.h Vector3.h.
4. Updated Vector3::getPseudorandomSphereVector to use C++11 cbrt function if available.



2015 November 21
----------------

1. Added isSameDirection function to Vector2 and Vector3 classes.



2015 November 23
----------------

1. Fixed addAllComponents in Vector3 to add to X, Y, and Z components instead of X, Y, and X again and renamed to addComponentsAll.



2015 November 30
----------------

1. Changed getTruncated function to Vector2 and Vector3 classes to be const.
2. Added asserts to getProjection, getAntiProjection, getProjection, and getAntiProjection functions to Vector2 and Vector3 classes to ensure resurned value is parallel or othoganal (as appropriate).



2015 December 6
---------------

1. Updated the comments for the drawMaterials function in ObjModel taking a vector of pointers.
2. Added versions of drawMaterials function to ObjModels that take vectors of C-strings and STL strings.
3. Added getMeshMaterialNames function to ObjModels that returns an STL vector of the names of the materials.
4. Added isSingleMaterial function to ObjModel.
5. Added getAsArray functions to Vector2 and Vector3 that reinterprets the Vector2/3 as an array of doubles.  Both classes have const and non-const variants.
6. Found a rare assert error in getAntiProjection functions in Vecto2 and Vector3.  IT is caused by floating point rounding, so I don't even know how to reproduce it, let alone ensure that it is fixed.



2015 December 7
---------------

1. Improved VECTOR2_IS_FINITE and VECTOR3_IS_FINITE macros in Vector2.h and Vector3.h.  They should work everywhere now.
2. Added isSameHemisphere function to Vector2 and Vector3 to determine if two Vector2/3s are within 90 degrees of each other.



2015 December 8
---------------

1. Added precondition to getDisplayList function documentation for ObjModel class.  Precondition was already in function implementation.
2. Added getDisplayListMaterial function to ObjModel with variants that take a Material, a C-string, and an STL string.
3. Various minor documentation fixes in ObjModel.h and Material.cpp.
4. Changed tolerance for norms and distances to use ratios instead of absolute values in Vector2 and Vector3.
5. Added isNormXYEqualTo, isNormXZEqualTo, and isNormYZEqualTo functions to Vector3 with versions that take scalar and vector parameters.
6. Added isAllComponentsNotEqualTo to Vecto2 and Vector3 with versions that take scalar and vector parameters.
7. Added a precondition to isDistanceEqualTo, isDistanceLessThan, and isGestanceGreaterThan functions in Vectir2 and Vector3 to ensure the comparison distance is non-neagative.
8. Fixed normalizeSafe in Vector2.h and setNormSafe in Vector2 and Vector3 so that they won't crash when given a zero vector.
9. Renamed isDistanceEqual function in Vector2 and Vecto3 to isDistanceEqualTo for consistancy with norm functions.
10.Changed getAntiprojection and getAntiprojectionNormal functions to always return zero whctor when vectors are parallel.  The very small vectors otherwise returned were not orthagonal.



2015 December 9
---------------

1. Moved tolerance constants outside the Vector2 and Vector3 classes.  This allows them to be declared in the .h file and thus ensures that they are initialized before they are used.
2. Changed getRandomSphereVector in Vector2.cpp and Vector3.cpp to use exact norm comparison instead of one with tolerance.



2016 January 16
---------------

1. Removed incorrect assert in getNormRatioSafe in Vector2/3 that required the second vector to be non-zero.  *Safe version should handle zero vectors.
2. Added asserts to getCosAngle, getCosAngleSafe, getAngle, and getAngleSafe in Vector2/3 to ensure that norms are non-zero.
3. Added asserts to getProjection in Vector2/3 to ensure that norm of vector projected onto is non-zero.
4. The isZero function in Vector2/3 now reports true if all components are anywhere in the range [-1.0e-100, 1.0e-100].  This prevents non-zero vectors from having norms of zero.  The original functionality is available as the isZeroStrit function.




TODO: Fix TextureBmp to load images with alpha channel correctly
TODO: Look at TextureBmp and non-power-of-2-sized images.  Is bad display caused by word alignment differences between BMP format and OpenGL?
TODO: Strip quotation marks from file names - especially internally-specified MTL files and textures.  Have to do tokens better.
TODO: Put everything in a namespace
TODO: Combine meshes with the same material in ObjModel
TODO: Add rotateTowards to Vector2 and Vector3 that takes a desired direction and a max angle.  Vector3 needs variants for full 3D, around principle axes, and around arbitrary axis.
TODO: Add isDistanceXYLessThan, etc. functions to Vector3.

TODO: Queue, Stack .cpp ==> .inl (replace these with STL versions?)
